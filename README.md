OLA _DATA _ ANALYSIS

This project provides a detailed analysis of OLA ride data, based on a dataset of around 100000+ rows records(initially). Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards that offer insights into key aspects of the business:
1.	Overall: Tracks ride volume trends and booking status breakdowns to understand demand and success rates.
2.	Vehicle Type: Highlights the top 5 vehicle types by total distance traveled.
3.	Revenue: Examines revenue distribution by payment methods, identifies top customers, and shows daily ride distance patterns.
4.	Cancellation: Breaks down ride cancellations by customer and driver reasons to pinpoint challenges.
5.	Ratings: Displays driver and customer ratings across vehicle categories to assess service quality.

ðŸ“Š Tools Used: Power BI | DAX | Power Query | Excel | MySQL

ðŸ“Š Key Highlights:

1,03,000+ total bookings analysed with 57M  booking value
Vehicle performance breakdown:
 Prime Sedan: 3.54M bookings, Avg. Distance 25.0 km
 Prime SUV: 3.29M bookings, Avg. Distance 24.8 km
 Mini: 3.3M bookings 
 Success Value 2.14M Auto,
 Bike & E-Bike covering 190K+
distance each 17,500 cancellations analysed with driver & customer reasons
Driver & Customer Ratings averaging 4.0 across categories

ðŸ’¡ Business Problems Solved:

âœ… Identifies peak booking trends to improve fleet allocation
âœ… Tracks cancellation patterns to address service gaps & reduce revenue loss
âœ… Compares vehicle performance to optimize pricing and availability
âœ… Monitors customer satisfaction to enhance service quality
âœ… Provides revenue breakdown by payment method for financial planning

This project enhanced my expertise in data modeling, DAX, and storytelling through visualization, while demonstrating how analytics can uncover key patterns in operations, customer behavior, and revenueâ€”ultimately driving informed decisions that support business growth and improve ride services..
